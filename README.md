# Shape calculator
A simple calculator implementation project for flat and three-dimensional shapes.  
The implementation of the figures leaves much to be desired.  Basic operations with shapes are described, there are not so many of them.
Please do not judge strictly, my brain flowed while I was writing this

Project structure:
• main.py - the file through which the program is launched.

• interface.py - is a module for working with user input.

• shapes.py - a module containing a class representation of shapes and methods for their calculations

• test_flat.py - tests for shapes.py, containing checks of flat shapes

• test_volumetric.py - the same, but for three-dimensional figures

To run the program, run the file main.py via the terminal with the command "python3 main.py " (for Windows - without "3").
To run tests, you can also run them through the terminal using the command above, but for the desired test (python 3 test_flat.py/test_volumeric.py), or through your development environment using a virtual environment for the convenience and beautiful output of these tests in the sidebar of your editor
